## Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Multi User Remote Desktop Server

Fully implemented Multi User xrdp with xorgxrdp and pulseaudio on Ubuntu 16.04.
Copy/Paste and sound is working. Users can re-login in the same session.
Xfce4, Firefox are pre installed.

## Usage

Start the rdp server

```bash
docker run -d --name uxrdp --hostname terminalserver --shm-size 1g -p 3389:3389 -p 2222:22 danielguerra/ubuntu-xrdp
```
*note if you allready use a rdp server on 3389 change -p <my-port>:3389
	  -p 2222:22 is for ssh access ( ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@<docker-ip> )

Connect with your remote desktop client to the docker server.
Use the Xorg session (leave as it is), user and pass.

## Sample user

There is a sample user with sudo rights

Username : ubuntu
Password : ubuntu

You can change your password in the rdp session in a terminal

```bash
passwd
```

## Add new users

No configuration is needed for new users just do

```bash
docker exec -ti uxrdp adduser mynewuser
```

After this the new user can login

## Add new services

To make sure all processes are working supervisor is installed.
The location for services to start is /etc/supervisor/conf.d

Example: Add mysql as a service

```bash
apt-get -yy install mysql-server
echo "[program:mysqld] \
command= /usr/sbin/mysqld \
user=mysql \
autorestart=true \
priority=100" > /etc/supervisor/conf.d/mysql.conf
supervisorctl update
```
